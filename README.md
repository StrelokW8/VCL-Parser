I had to parse a .log file (painfully structured), while also considering additional requirements set by the issuer. Later, the project was extended to include an XML log parser.
Additionally, I explored VCL for a simpler demonstration.

Published for laughs and as a reminder of my first paid projectâ€”because most of us start from the bottom.
